/**
 * A common interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 * <b>NOTE: This interface does not imply specific auto-startup semantics.
 * Consider implementing {@link SmartLifecycle} for that purpose.</b>
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in a
 * Spring context) and containers  (typically a Spring {@link ApplicationContext}
 * itself). Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that
 * apply within each container, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime.
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * will typically be defined with an
 * {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler},
 * restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>Note that the present {@code Lifecycle} interface is only supported on
 * <b>top-level singleton beans</b>. On any other component, the {@code Lifecycle}
 * interface will remain undetected and hence ignored. Also, note that the extended
 * {@link SmartLifecycle} interface provides sophisticated integration with the
 * application context's startup and shutdown phases.
